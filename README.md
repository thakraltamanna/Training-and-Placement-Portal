# Training & Placement Portal (DSA + Python GUI Project)

This is a DSA-based Python GUI project that simulates a Training & Placement Portal. It handles placement allocations based on two different preferences:
- Company-wise preference allocation
- Student-wise preference allocation

The goal is to demonstrate how core DSA concepts can be applied in a real-world application with an interactive Python GUI.

## Features

- **Student Module**: Enter preferences for companies.
- **Company Module**: Enter preferences for students.
- **Allocation Engine**: Matches students to companies in two ways:
  - Company-first: Allocation based on each company's ranked preference list.
  - Student-first: Allocation based on students' ranked preferences.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A clean and simple interface built using Python's GUI toolkit.
